### Background

This [FHIR Implementation Guide](https://www.hl7.org/fhir/implementationguide.html) (IG) is an example of using FHIR Shorthand to develop an IG.

Pulmonary function testing (PFT) is a complete evaluation of the respiratory system including patient history, physical examinations, and tests of pulmonary function. The primary purpose of pulmonary function testing is to identify the severity of pulmonary impairment. Pulmonary function testing has diagnostic and therapeutic roles and helps clinicians answer some general questions about patients with lung disease. PFTs are normally performed by a pulmonary function technician, respiratory therapist, respiratory physiologist, physiotherapist, pulmonologist, or general practitioner.

Pulmonary function testing is a diagnostic and management tool used for a variety of reasons, such as:

* Diagnose lung disease.
* Monitor the effect of chronic diseases like asthma, chronic obstructive lung disease, or cystic fibrosis.
* Detect early changes in lung function.
* Identify narrowing in the airways.
* Evaluate airway bronchodilator reactivity.
* Show if environmental factors have harmed your lungs

[Spirometry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirometry) is the most common method of measurement and includes tests of pulmonary mechanics. Measuring pulmonary mechanics assesses the ability of the lungs to move huge volumes of air quickly through the airways to identify airway obstruction.
